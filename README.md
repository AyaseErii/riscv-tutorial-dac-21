## Materials for the Hands-on portion 
We'll be using the System Architect CoreGen repository [here](https://github.com/opensocsysarch/CoreGen) for the hands-on portion of this tutorial. The [BasicRV32I.yaml file under Exercises](https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/riscv-tutorial-dac-21/blob/main/Exercises/BasicRV32I.yaml) will be used as the starting file for the hands-on portion of the tutorial.

## VM Images and Remote Temporary Accounts

[Remote Access for the DAC-58 RISC-V GPGPU tutorial](https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/vortex_tutorials/blob/main/Remote%20Access%20for%20the%20MICRO-54%20Vortex%20GPGPU%20tutorial.md)

VM Access (Optional): Please see the ["VM README"](VM_Imgs/VM_README.md) to get instructions for downloading and running the System Architect tools using Vagrant and VirtualBox. We suggest you use this option to continue your exploration after the tutorial as the image is somewhat large (1.1 GB).

For remote account access, please see [this page](Remote%20Access%20for%20the%20MICRO-54%20Vortex%20GPGPU%20tutorial.md). If you'd like a longer-term account to work with Coregen and the tools on a remote testbed, please [request an account for the CRNCH Rogues Gallery testbed here](https://crnch-rg.cc.gatech.edu/request-access/).
